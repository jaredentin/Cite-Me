# Cite-Me
Never forget the smart (or dumb) things your friends have said.

Cite Me is a Google Chrome extension currently under development. It functions as a personal touch for one's online experiences, enabling him or her to add "quotes" that are associated with his or her friends. Once a quote is added, anyone in that individual's "group" can view his or her associated quote in the browser.

Inspiration for this project comes from The Trumpweb, a similar extension from the Chrome Web Store that associates actual Donald Trump quotes to his name on the browser.

This current version uses the jQuery Validator plugin, which is not included in this repository.
